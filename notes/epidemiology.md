## Questions

1. What are are epidemics and how do they happen?
2. What can history teach us?
3. What data / statistical distribution do we have for impact per event?
4. What models can we use to understand them?
5. What different types are there and what significance does this have?
6. When and why do epidemics become panademics?

## Notes

**(Pandemics: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions), Christian W. McMillen (2016))[https://www.amazon.com/Pandemics-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions-ebook-dp-B01N2LLMXE/dp/B01N2LLMXE/]:**

Chapter on 1918 Influenza (Spanish flu)

- Impact: 1/3 of population got infected and ~50m died, happened in 3 waves of a few months each, 2nd most deadly
- Normal: Flu every season, pandemics come around every generation or so, this one especially bad
- Remote places: Remote places were hit, often worse, also quarantines were effective in e.g. American Samoa
- Quarantines: Arguably, quarantines has a long history and may have contributed to modern state, e.g. Italy 500 years ago, etc
- Hubris and censorship: UK not taking it seriously thinking they had germ theory of disease so all good, Italian gov censoring deaths
- Shapeshifter: Flu as shapeshifter, while we have progressed in some areas, in other same ignorance as 500y ago for pandemic influenza

Follow up questions:
- Is there less verbalistic and more data/statistics on remote places infection rate and quarantine effectiveness?
- More sources on connection between public health / quarantines and emergence of modern state? Similar to cities -> epidemics
