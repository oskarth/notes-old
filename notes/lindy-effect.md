## Thoughts on neomania

It strikes me that the reason people think knowledge is changing so quickly is because we are more connected. More connected means less of a filter (or worse, impotent filters), which means we receive news-y knowledge. This naturally implies a short half life. If this is true, even to some extent, it seems quite significant.

How can we confirm this?
