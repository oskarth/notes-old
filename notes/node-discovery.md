## Questions

1. What are different methods of node discovery? What are their pros and cons?
2. What security threats should be worried about? When it comes to eclipse attacks, censorship resistance etc
3. Which methods are most suitable resource restricted devices?
4. How do we identify nodes, and what are some pros and cons of this?

## Notes

**EIP 1459: Node Discovery via DNS (Lange, Szil√°gyi, 2018)** (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1459):

- Proposes using DNS as a discovery mechanism for bootstrap nodes in Ethereum. This allows for more (dynamic) bootstrap nodes vs embedding them in short client list.
- If joining DHT is difficult due to restricted restricted network, DNS alone can work, since DNS is available anywhere.
- Uses a merkle tree of node records, so a single signature of the root is sufficient to authenticate the whole node list.

Follow up questions:
- When it comes to normal nodes, what are the advantages of using Discovery v5?
- How does this work in Bitcoin?

**Node Discovery Protocol v5 (Lange, Oct 2019 draft)** (https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md):

- Node Discovery protocol for Ethereum stack, based on Kademlia DHT.
- Allows sampling of whole network, topic registration and discovery, and authoritative most-recent location.
- Compared to MDNS/Bonjour it is not just local network, whole Internet (DHT address space).
- Compared to rendezvous points less trusted/single point of failure
- Achilles heel is joining the network, which nodes do you start with? Bootstrap problem, use e.g. DNS (see above).

Follow up questions:
- RLP based, how does that work for Ethereum 2 stack?
- How does topic registration and discovery work in more detail?

**EIP 778: Ethereum Node Records (ENR) (Lange, 2017)** (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778):

- Node identity used for Ethereum Discovery to know how to connect to a node. Extend Discovery v4, where only pubkey, IP and port was specified. Provides more flexibility.
- Node record: Signature of content, sequence number (+1 every update) and arbitrary set of key-value pairs, RLP encoded.
- Extensibility: For adding new keypairs, no consensus needed. To change identity scheme consensus is needed so nodes know how to validate the signature.

Follow up questions:
- If we wanted wanted to make RLP pluggable, could we, realistically speaking? How does this look in Eth2/IPFS?
- With something like multiaddr, could we make the identity scheme self-declaring and remove consensus requirement?
- In Bittorrent, Bitcoin and other previous p2p networks, how does node identity?
