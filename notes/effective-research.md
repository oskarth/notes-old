## Questions

Interested in answering the following questions:

1. How do we do research the most effective way?
2. What activities should we do focus on and how?

## Notes

**How to read a paper** (https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf):
- Depth of reading: Outlines how to read a paper the right way. Suggests breaking it down into three parts: skimming (5-10m), reading (1-5h), deep studying. - For each part, produce some artifact of notes.
- Skimming: When skimming, only read introduction, headings, conclusions, and glance at everything else. For skimming, you should know rough category, contribution and context and if it is valuable to read further.
- Literature review: When doing a literature review, check e.g. scholar for recent papers with high citations. Then take top 3-5, look for common cited works. See what those people are up to.

Reminds me of this comment on HN by Michael Nielsen [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=666615):

> I was a theoretical physicist for 13 years, and struggled a lot with this question. I found it very useful to develop several different styles for reading mathematics and physics. Mostly I did this in the context of reading papers, not books, but the comments below are easily adapted to books.

> One unusual but very useful style was to set a goal like reading 15 papers in 3 hours. I use the term "reading" here in an unusual way. Of course, I don't mean understanding everything in the papers. Instead, I'd do something like this: for each paper, I had 12 minutes to read it. The goal was to produce a 3-point written LaTeX summary of the most important material I could extract: usually questions, open problems, results, new techniques, or connections I hadn't seen previously. When time was up, it was onto the next paper. A week later, I'd make a revision pass over the material, typically it would take an hour or so.

> I found this a great way of rapidly getting an overview of a field, understanding what was important, what was not, what the interesting questions were, and so on. In particular, it really helped identify the most important papers, for a deeper read.

> For deeper reads of important papers or sections of books I would take days, weeks or months. Giving lectures about the material and writing LaTeX lecture notes helped a lot.

**How to write a great research paper (Peyton Jones)** (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-to-write-a-great-research-paper.pdf):

- Write first, do research later. Idea > Write > Research. Forces questions and what you don't understand to crystallize. Don't need to have a perfect idea to start.
- Have one clear 'ping'. One single, sharp idea. Should be very evident what that is. If multiple ideas, write multiple papers.
- Introduction: State problem and singular contribution. That's it. Make the diff with current knowledge clear.
- Reviewer and reader. Pay a lot of attention to both! Any reviewer comment helpful. Make text readable and intuition based initially, like you are describing on a whiteboard.
