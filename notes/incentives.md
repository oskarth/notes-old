## Questions

1. How do we design protocols with proper incentives?
2. How do we properly account for services being used by the network?

Most immediate:

- What would an accounting module look like? What resources/services can and should we leverage?
- What are some related work people are working on here?

- [ ] live thread https://forum.vac.dev/t/accounting-for-resources-in-waku-and-beyond/31

- Is there any research on incentivized gossiping?
- What is the latest on Kademlia and similar for incentives?
- Is there a good survey paper on cryptoeconomic games?
