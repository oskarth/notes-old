## Questions

1. What makes a great protocol and how do we design one?
2. How can we be confident that our protocol works the way we expect it to?
3. How do we ensure modularity, flexibility and interoperability?
4. How do we make protocols user-friendly and more likely to be adapted?

N.B. This one might be too broad, but restricting topic to just "capabilities" seems too narrow.

Most immediate question is the following:

- How should Waku capabilities be designed and communicated, especially in the context of something like libp2p?
